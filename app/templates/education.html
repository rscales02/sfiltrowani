            exceptions. And by no means, it is not a reason for joy - although it brings Poland a lot of publicity in
            the world, it is a black press. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), 33 out of 50
            cities in the European Union with the highest concentration of PM2.5 dust are in Poland, and according to
            the tragic data of the European Environment Agency, nearly 45,000 people die every year in Poland due to
            pollution (exactly 44,600 in 2015, and this number increased from 42.412 from 2011) After a few years of
            publicity, it seems that we should know everything about smog, but does not our knowledge close in terms of

            is generated, produced by people. It comes from the emission of coal produced while driving a car, the
            functioning of industry, smoke from fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions. Smoke from
            chimneys produced during smoking in heating furnaces in the winter season plays a major role in creating
            smog. Smog consists, among others, of nitrogen oxides, sulfur, coal and aromatic hydrocarbons as well as
            heavy metals. It also consists of microscopic dusts and harmful chemical compounds.") }}</p>

            the winter season.  According to the data of the Main Inspectorate for Environmental Protection, households
            heating with solid fuels, eg coal, are in Poland as much as 48 percent.  The emission of carbon generated
            during the car's driving also has a large impact on the formation of smog.") }}</p>
